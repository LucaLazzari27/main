# Calliope-NL-stylised
A model of the Dutch power system with province-scale resolution (NUTS2, 12 nodes). The model is stylised and, for now, conceived primarily for education or research prototyping (e.g., algorithm testing) purposes.

## Requirements
The model is built on the Python-based open-source energy modelling framework Calliope, version 0.6.10. 
To be ready to run the model, we recommend following first the [instructions for installing Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html).

## Overview
The repository includes a Jupyter notebook (`model_run_walkthrough.ipynb`) to walk new users through the model, including example modes of usage - such as system design or operation analysis - and illustrative options for scenario customisation. The notebook is accompanied by a Python script (`convert_plan_to_fixed_design`), which the notebook imports as a function to enable to automated creation of a scenario that fixes the system design to what gets found by the (default) 'plan' mode of Calliope. By fixing the design via this automatically created scenario, users can test the operation of their design across varying operating conditions.

All input data and model specifications are in the `model_files` directory. In particular, the directory includes: the master `model.yaml` file, which defines the main model features and imports all other YAML files with additional details; the `scenarios.yaml` file, with some example plug-and-play model modifications; and the `fixed-design-cost-optimal.yaml` file, which is automatically created by the Jupyter notebook after finding the cost-optimal system design to allow re-running the same design with varying operation assumptions. The time series data lie in the `timeseries_data` sub-directory, while the characteristics of technologies, networks and nodes are in the `techs_and_locs` sub-directory. The `results` sub-directory is envisioned to host the results and already includes the example outputs based on the included Jupyter notebook.

The data sources are the following:
- Techno-economic technology data come from the Danish Energy Agency technology catalogues and are interpolated to represent projections to the year 2025
- Renewables time series come from the [renewables.ninja](www.renewables.ninja) project
- Demand time series come from Open Power System Data [(OPSD)](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/2020-10-06) and are regionalised proportionally to the GDP of each province
- Grid constraints are generated by making use of the [PyPSA-Eur workflow](https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur) and its customisation to NUTS2/3 regions made by [Bobby Xiong](https://github.com/bobbyxng/kodekiste)

## Limitations

The model currently comes with several limitations as it is not intended to approximate the real-world system accurately but rather to enable teaching and research testing activities. Some of the main limitations to keep in mind are listed below.
- Import and export of electricity from/to other countries is stylised and does not have any transmission constraints nor any weather dependency
- Maximum potentials for renewables are highly simplified, homogeneous across regions and not based on land availability data
- The range of available technologies is rather limited, especially concerning conventional power plants
- Offshore wind time series are not spatially explicit, although solar and onshore wind time series are
- The optimisation is mostly greenfield; there is no information on current capacities except for the transmission capacity
- The expansion of transmission capacity is highly simplified: each line can be expanded to a maximum of 5x the current capacity
